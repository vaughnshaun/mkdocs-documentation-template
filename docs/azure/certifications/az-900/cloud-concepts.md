Cloud is changing the way people interact with their computers, phones, and other devices. It allows businesses to produce at speeds much greater than the pre cloud generation. It is the basis for most technology nowadays. Users see this in services such as Netflix, TikTok, Snapchat, iCloud storage, etc. 

## What is Cloud Computing?
But what is cloud? Most people say, "oh cloud is just a bunch of computers networked together". While this statement is true, it minimizes the true definition of the cloud. 

The cloud is a distributed network of computers. Cloud providers use proprietary virtualization technology to share compute resources. This ensures that no compute resources are wasted. The cloud enables quick provisioning of resources without the need of maintenance.

***Cloud offers 4 basic benefits to users.***

1. Delivery - Delivery of compute resources. 
2. Cloud - Resources provisioned from the internet. Traditional data centers not needed. 
3. Pay as you go - Pay for what you use. 
4. Competition - Fast deployment to beat competition.

## Microsoft Azure
Azure is a cloud service by Microsoft. To get started with Azure, a Microsoft account is required. To start creating resources, two basic units are required. A subscription should be created to manage billing. Multiple subscriptions can be created under one account. Multiple subscriptions are useful for creating separate billing: per department, application, etc.

After creating a subscription, a resource group should be created. A resource group is created under a subscription. A resource group is a logical grouping of resources. A resource must belong to a group and can only belong to one. A common pattern is to have one group per environment region. For example rg-dev-myapp-centralus. A resource is a basic unit of the Azure cloud. 

### Provision Resources
Azure allows for the provisioning of resources. Provisioning is defined as the life cycle states of a resource at any given moment. A resource can be created, updated, deleted, or deallocated. Resources are created via services.
